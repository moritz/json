An initial Perl 6 grammar for JSON.

This is a work in progress. For more information please join #perl6 on
irc.freenode.net, and talk to moritz or viklund, or write a mail to
perl6-users@perl.org.

To build and test this module, please get 'ufo' from
http://github.com/masak/ufo and run:

    ufo
    make
    make test

(You would normally be able to install this with panda, but it happens to be
one of the prerequisites for panda itself -- so until Rakudo does automatic
recompiles, panda will become very confused after completing the install.
New, tested versions of this module should be imported into panda's source
in ext/JSON__Tiny/, and panda's reboostrap.pl run.)

State:

    The parser is pretty complete, if you find anything that it should
    parse and doesn't, or the other way round, please let me know.

    The emitter works.

    Both currently ignore possible surrogate pairs.
